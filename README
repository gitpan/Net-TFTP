Net::TFP was previously part of the libnet distribution. But has now
been separated out to a distribution of its own.

INSTALLATION

Installastion is the same as any other MakeMaker packaged distribution
from CPAN.

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

If you are on a mchine where Makemaker does not run, or you do
not have a copy of make, then you can simply copy the TFTP.pm
file from this directory into a Net subdirectory in your
perl installation library directory.
